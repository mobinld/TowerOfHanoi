# TowerOfHanoi
FP midterm project
/ Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) Fall 2017-2018

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. (By Wikipedia)

This project represents this game in console environment with some graphical extensions.
Hope to enjoy!
